* Resource
    The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. Any information that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a temporal service, a collection of other resources, a non-virtual object ... and so on.

    In other words, any concept that might be target of an author's hypertext reference must fit within the definition os a resource.

    A resource is a conceptual mapping to a set of entities not the entity that crossponds to the mapping at any particular point in time. 

    REST components perform action on a resource by using a representation to capture the current or intended state of that resource and transferring that representation between components.

* Rest Server - Creates a unique representation that can be modified to fit specification

* Resource - The data contained at the end of the resource URI
* Representation - Representation of the data obtained on access
